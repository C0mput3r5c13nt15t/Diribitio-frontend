Just take a look around!  \nIf you like what you see concider writing me a nice e-mail with some feedback!\nAbout the App\nRight here you can see the documentaion for the Frontend of my Web-project. It was build using Angular and Ionic and documented with compodoc.It's based off the tabs-template and includes five Tabs:\n\nHome\nLog-In\nImprint\nSettings\n\nIt has a mobile and a desktop view, which will adjust to the screen size in real time and reload after resizing.Currently it contains 40 modules (36 pages) and 10 services for settings, http-requests, etc.There are three user-types with corresponding pages:\n\nAdmins\nStudents\nProject leaders\n\nWhat does it do?\nIts the user-interface to the corresponding backend. The functionality depends on the user-type:\n\nAdmins:\nManage the schedule\nManage the projects, students and project leaders\nAllow new Admins\nCarry out exchanges\nAssign the students to the projects (with the help of an algorithm)\n\n\nStudents:\nCreate a project\nExpress wishes for projects\nManage created projects (e.g. Write messages)\nAssign assistants\nParticipate in a project\nCreate/accept exchange requests\n\n\nProject leaders:\nCreate a project\nManage created projects (e.g. Write messages)\n\n\n\nOnly in german?\nSadly the currently Frontend doesn't support any other languages, except for German.\nCan I get the project?\nAt the current point in time, because the app is still in deveploment and hasn't been tested enought. Once all of this is done there will be a link to the git-repository with the full project and an installation guide for setting it up on a server. So just be patient! If you are interested, just conatct me via email!\nWho did this?\nBasically just me :) and if you want to conatct me here's my email:-> pauljustus279@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
