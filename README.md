# Diribitio - frontend

## Hello!
Welcome to my web project. Just take a look around!  
If you like what you see concider writing me a nice e-mail with some feedback!

## About the App
Right here you can see the documentaion for the Frontend of my Web-project. It was build using Angular and Ionic and documented with compodoc.  
It's based off the tabs-template and includes five Tabs:
- Home
- Log-In
- Imprint
- Settings

It has a mobile and a desktop view, which will adjust to the screen size in real time and reload after resizing.  
Currently it contains 40 modules (36 pages) and 10 services for settings, http-requests, etc.  
There are three user-types with corresponding pages:
- Admins
- Students
- Project leaders

## What does it do?
Its the user-interface to the corresponding backend. The functionality depends on the user-type:
- Admins:
    - Manage the schedule
    - Manage the projects, students and project leaders
    - Allow new Admins
    - Carry out exchanges
    - Assign the students to the projects (with the help of an algorithm)
- Students:
    - Create a project
    - Express wishes for projects
    - Manage created projects (e.g. Write messages)
    - Assign assistants
    - Participate in a project
    - Create/accept exchange requests
- Project leaders:
    - Create a project
    - Manage created projects (e.g. Write messages)

## Only in german?
Sadly the currently Frontend doesn't support any other languages, except for German.

## Can I get the project?
At the current point in time, because the app is still in deveploment and hasn't been tested enought. Once all of this is done there will be a link to the git-repository with the full project and an installation guide for setting it up on a server. So just be patient! If you are interested, just conatct me via email!
